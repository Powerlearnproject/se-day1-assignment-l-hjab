#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a branch of computer science used for designing ,developing, testing and maintaining software.The following are importance of software engineering;
Scalability – it helps software functions properly  and ensures changes can be made anytime.
Efficiency –it  Saves time and resources by following structured processes during development.
Reliability – Reduces bugs and ensures the software works correctly.  to ensure efficiency
Maintainability – Makes it easier to update and improve software.it also make sure the software is up-to date.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 a) The 1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering
It is considered as the birth of software engineering,It addressed the software crisis, where software projects were failing due to poor planning, lack of structure, and increasing complexity. It emphasized the need for systematic engineering principles in software development.
2. The Rise of Structured Programming 
 It introduced by computer scientists like Edsger Dijkstra, structured programming replaced chaotic "spaghetti code" with a disciplined approach using loops, conditionals, and functions.This improved code readability, maintainability, and debugging, leading to more reliable software systems.
3. The Agile development 
Agile development emerged as a response to the inefficiencies of traditional Waterfall models, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.planning - identify the software requirement ,planning and identifying objectives.
2.requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. 
3.design - building the framework and designing the software. 
4.coding and implementstion- coding using programming languages 
5. testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches
6.deploment- after testing the software is deployed ready for use.
7.maintenance- frequents maintance are done to keep the software upto date.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile model is a software development approach that  focuses on delivering small, incremental improvements to a product rather than completing it in a single phase. Agile promotes adaptability to changing requirements and continuous customer feedback.Agile is ideal for projects requiring flexibility, frequent updates, and collaboration.
Iterative Development – Work is broken into small, manageable iterations (or sprints).
Customer Collaboration – Frequent interaction with stakeholders ensures the product meets expectations.
Flexibility – Changes can be incorporated at any stage.
Cross-Functional Teams – Developers, testers, and designers work together closely.
Example of agile methodology is Developing a mobile app where Features may evolve based on user feedback.

Waterfall is a traditional software development methodology that follows a linear and sequential approach. Each phase must be completed before moving to the next, with minimal flexibility for changes.
key characteristics of waterfall
Strictly Sequential: Phases do not overlap.
Extensive Documentation: Each phase requires detailed documentation.
Minimal Client Involvement: Customers see the product only after development.
Difficult to Make Changes: Changes after development are costly and complex.
Waterfall can be used to develop Banking Software which requires high security, compliance, and documentation.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer 
- developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
 - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
 - 
Quality Assurance Engineer
 - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
 - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
 - confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 
- analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
- develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
- 
Project Manager
 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.
 - - assembles and lead the software development team.
 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
 - create blueprint for the project


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

 Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) is a software application that provides comprehensive tools to assist developers in writing, testing, and debugging code efficiently.
Importance :
   Features like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and debugging tools speed up development.
   Helps organize large projects by integrating files, classes, and dependencies.
   Built-in debuggers make identifying and fixing errors easier.
   Many IDEs support Git, SVN, and other version control tools.
Examples of IDEs:
   Visual Studio Code (VS Code) 
   IntelliJ IDEA.
   PyCharm 

Version Control Systems (VCS) is a system that tracks changes to source code over time, allowing developers to collaborate, revert changes, and maintain different versions of a project.
Importance
 Teams can work on the same project without overwriting each other's code.
 Changes can be tracked, and previous versions can be restored if necessary.
 Developers can work on separate features without affecting the main codebase.
 Tracks every modification, making it easier to review changes.
Examples of VCS
-Git 
-Apache Subversion (SVN)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

a)Meeting Project Deadlines
Delays in development can impact product delivery and stakeholder expectations.
    Solution: Use Agile methodologies such as Kanban to break projects into smaller, achievable tasks.
   Set realistic deadlines based on proper time estimation techniques .

b) Balancing Performance and Security
 Optimizing software for speed while ensuring security can be tricky.
     Solution:Perform code reviews and security audits regularly.
     Use performance profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and improve efficiency.
     
c) Handling User Requirements and Scope Creep
Requirements may change frequently, leading to uncontrolled project expansion.
Solutions: Clearly define project scope with stakeholders to manage expectations.
Prioritize features based on business value using MoSCoW  prioritization.
 
 d)Managing Complex Codebases
Large projects can have thousands of lines of code, making them difficult to maintain.
Solutions: Use modular programming to break code into smaller, manageable components.

e) Debugging and Fixing Bugs
 Identifying and fixing bugs can be time-consuming and frustrating.
Solutions: Use debugging tools available in IDEs.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit tests - It involves testing  of individual  components and modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.

 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 - 
 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .

Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. 
They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective prompts to guide AI models, like Copilot,gemini, to generate the most accurate, relevant, and useful responses.
Importance of prompt Engineering
a)Enhancement of the user experience: 
       Users may easily get pertinent results in the first prompt thanks to prompt engineering.  In the training data of big language models, it helps reduce potential 
       bias resulting from human bias.
 b)Greater adaptability:
      A prompt engineer can draw attention to broad patterns and logical connections by crafting prompts with domain-neutral instructions.
 c)Developer control:
      Developers have more authority over how users engage with the AI thanks to prompt engineering.  The big language models are given context and intent by effective prompts.  After giving an example of an ambiguous prompt, make it more precise, succinct, and clear.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
 Vague Prompt
   Who is the president of the country?

Clear prompt
 Who is the current president of Kenya?
 
Clarity: The clear prompt specifies what is being asked (the current president).
Specific Details: States the name of the country (current president of akaenya).
Concise: The additional details provide a clear statement without being overly complicated
